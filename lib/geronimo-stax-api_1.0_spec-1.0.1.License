      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Common Public License - v 1.0 


THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 


1. DEFINITIONS 

"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' 
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor 
itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not 
include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of 
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own 
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 


"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which 
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or 
when combined with the Program. 


"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement. 


"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors. 


2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly 
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, 
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by 
the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination 
to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply 
to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se 
is licensed hereunder. 

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses 
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims 
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on 
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to 
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby 
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to 
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license 
set forth in this Agreement.
 
3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:
   
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title 
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability 
and fitness for a particular purpose; 

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
damages, such as lost profits; 

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered 
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on 
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within 
the Program. 

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities 
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this 
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the 
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering 
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for 
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") 
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified 
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") 
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third 
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating 
to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to 
qualify, 
an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, 
the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified 
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 


For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, 
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and 
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under 
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims 
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and 
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any 
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 


5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED 
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining 
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all 
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, 
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or 
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 


7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action 
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 


If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with 
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that 
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as 
of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient 
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim 
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding 
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes 
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under 
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 


All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails 
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement 
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this 
Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the 
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations 
under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the 
Program shall continue and survive. 


Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may 
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves 
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement 
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right 
to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may 
assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may 
always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which 
it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is 
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its 
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in 
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to 
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether 
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program 
not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 


This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury 
trial in any resulting litigation.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe
Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your
Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients
rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form
under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license
steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the
license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version
of this License if You: (a)árename the license and remove any
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
license differs from this License); and (b)áotherwise make it clear
that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
     breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
     beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
     judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
     Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
     claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the
     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
     Contributors under Sectionsá2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
     upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
     automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
     unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with
     respect to the Participant Software against such Participant
     either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
     Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sectionsá6.1 or 6.2 above, all
     end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in
48áC.F.R.á2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer
software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. á252.227-7014(a)(1))
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used
in 48áC.F.R.á12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu
of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
with the United States export administration regulations (and the
export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You
use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The GlassFish code released under the CDDL
shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM
is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of
the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version
is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: 
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with 
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not 
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, 
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of 
the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed 
Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations 
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. 
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims 
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights 
and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, 
if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's 
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code 
form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions 
of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
consequential 
damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
 Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities 
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While 
this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the 
Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create 
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend 
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") 
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
 distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
 must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with 
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not 
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with 
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, 
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT 
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON 
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF 
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS 
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including 
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program 
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's 
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails 
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement 
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under 
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution 
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's 
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may 
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves 
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement 
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right 
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement 
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as 
the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of 
the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program 
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the 
version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after 
a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to 
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
 Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient 
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any 
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted 
under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to 
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights 
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
