Description: Peer-to-Peer Web Search Engine
 YaCy is a Java-based peer-to-peer search engine.
 It provides a personal web search engine, which is
 free and decentralized. The search index is distributed
 over a p2p network. It contains a crawler, an indexer
 and an own database engine. In the 'robinson-modus', YaCy
 can be used for a topic-oriented search portal or to index an
 intranet.
