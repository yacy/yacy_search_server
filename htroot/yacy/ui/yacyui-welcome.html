<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	YaCy-UI is going to be a JavaScript based client for YaCy based on the existing XML and JSON API. 
	YaCy-UI is at most alpha status, as there is still problems with retriving the search results.
	I am currently changing the backend to a more application friendly format and getting good results with it (I will check that in some time after the stable release 0.7).
	For now have a look at the bookmarks, performance has increased significantly, due to the use of JSON and Flexigrid!
