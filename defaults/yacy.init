# federated index storage and federated search functionality
# federated search means that other search engines may be used together with the built-in indexing.
# each federated search may be able to be used as remote indexing service and/or as remote search service.
# a typical use case for a federated search is a concurrent search from opensearch sources.
# a typical use case for a remote indexing service is a remote solr index. YaCy supports remote solr indexes.

# solr indexes can be filled if enabled is set to true
# the remote index scheme is the same as produced by the SolrCell; see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtractingRequestHandler
# because this default scheme is used the default example scheme can be used as solr configuration
# to use this, do the following:
# - set federated.service.solr.indexing.enabled = true
# - download solr from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/
# - extract the solr (3.1) package, 'cd example' and start solr with 'java -jar start.jar'
# - start yacy and then start a crawler. The crawler will fill both, YaCy and solr indexes.
# - to check whats in solr after indexing, open http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/
